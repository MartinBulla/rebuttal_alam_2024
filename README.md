[Data](Data/):
- [Fig_4c.csv](Data/Fig_4c.csv): source data provided by [Alam et al. (2024, *Nature*)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07207-4); columns: *tutor* - unique tutor ID, *pupil* - unique pupil ID for the given tutor, *tutor_path* - song path length of the tutor, *pupil_path* - song path length of the pupil
- [Dat_path_length.csv](Data/DAT_path_length.csv): 20 UMAP iterrations generated from 31 tutored birds of Alam et al.'s Fig 2c (available from https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/WBQM4I/Q92O9A), using Alam et al.'s methods to:
    -  [generate the UMAP](https://github.com/ymir-k/UMAP_test/blob/main/AlamTests/3-RseedTest/Scripts/generate_rseed_embeddings.ipynb)
    - [find centroids of clusters](https://github.com/ymir-k/UMAP_test/blob/main/AlamTests/3-RseedTest/Scripts/find_kmeans_centroids_of_rseed_embeddings.ipynb)
    - [calculate shortest path length for each male](https://github.com/ymir-k/UMAP_test/blob/main/AlamTests/3-RseedTest/Scripts/bird_paths_from_many_kcentroids.ipynb)
- [Fig_2b.csv](Data/Fig_2b.csv): source data provided by [Alam et al. (2024, *Nature*)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07207-4) and data measured by us from their Extended Data Fig. 6 (green versus black bars during playback); columns: *trial_id* - unique trial ID, *side_bias* - was the long-path song during the trial played in the *preferred arm* or *non-preferred arm* by the female during the baseline period?, *song_pair* - unique song-pair ID; *long* - path length of the long path song, *short* - path length of the short path song, *pre* - the percentage of pre-trial time spent in the arm where long path song would be played during the trial, *trial* -  the percentage of trial time spent in the arm with long path song, *post* - the percentage of post-trial time spent in the arm where long path song was played during the trial, *trial_long* - trial time spent in the arm with long path song, *trial_short* - trial time spent in the arm with short path song
- [match_labels_output.csv](Data/match_labels_output.csv): contains matched bird ids and names from the Fig_4c.csv and Fig. 2c (Dat_path_length.csv) generated by the procedure described [here](Python/create_bird_labels.pdf) and used to add syllable counts to Fig_2b.csv data; columns: *f2b_bird_id* - unique bird ID from Fig. 2b, *f2b_bird_name* - unique bird name from Fig. 2b, *superset_bird_id* - unique bird ID from Fig. 4c, Alam et al's file tut.zip, *superset_bird_name* - unique bird name from Fig. 4c, Alam et al's file tut.zip, *superset_bird_cleaned_name* - Fig. 4c bird names cleaned to match the Fig. 2b names, *superset_bird_type* - was the bird isolated or tutored, *superset_bird_nsyll* - number of unique syllables in a given song
- [Dat_rnorm.Rdata](Data/Dat_rnorm.Rdata): random data from the Fig 1 generated in the [Fig_point_1.r](R/Fig_point_1.r) script

[R](R/)-scripts used in the analysis:

For the first submission:
- [Fig_point_1.r](R/Fig_point_1.r) uses [Fig_4c.csv](Data/Fig_4c.csv) and generates our [Fig. 1](Output/Fig_point_1.png),
- [Fig_point_2.r](R/Fig_point_2.r) uses [rebuttal_fig_2.csv](Data/rebuttal_fig_2.csv) and generates our [Fig. 2](Output/Fig_point_2.png) 

For the revision
- [rev_Point_1.r](R/rev_Point_1.r) uses [Fig_4c.csv](Data/Fig_4c.csv) and generates 
    - our revised [Fig. 1](Output/Fig_point_1_width-143mm.png), and 
    - [rev_Reply_1.png](rev_Reply_1.png) used in our responses to the referees comments
- [rev_Point_2.r](R/rev_Point_2.r) uses [path_length_df.csv](Data/path_length_df.csv) and generates repeatability estimates and our new [Fig. 2](Output/Fig_2.png)
- [rev_Point_3.r](R/rev_Point_3.r) uses [rebuttal_fig_2.csv](Data/rebuttal_fig_2.csv) and generates revised initial Fig. 2, now [Fig. 3](Output/Fig_point_3.png)
- [rev_Extended_Data_1.R](R/rev_Extended_Data_1.r) generates [Extended Data Fig.1](Output/Extended_Data_1.png)

[Output](Output/): contains the generated figures in PNG format

### Demo & Reproduction Instructions
We do not provide any demo data, because the two *csv* files used in the analyses are small and already contain all the data used in the analyses. 

To generate Fig. 1 and/or Fig. 2, download the [two csv files](Data/) into *Data* folder of your project's root directory and create a folder *Output*. Open *R* software and the *Fig_point_1.r* or  *Fig_point_2.r* R-script, install the R-packages indicated under the tools by running *install.packages(c('data.table', 'ggplot2', 'ggpmisc', 'ggpubr', 'grid', 'patchwork')* and run the script. The pngs of the figures will be generated in *Output*.
