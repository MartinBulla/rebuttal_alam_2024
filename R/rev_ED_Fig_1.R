#' Probability of incorrect "long-path" song classification  within a stimulus pair given their path-length difference, estimated from a single iteration.** Points represent individual cases, stacked using `geom_dotplot()` R-function. The line with a shaded area represents the predicted probabiity with a 95% credible interval, based on the joint posterior distribution of 5,000 simulated values from a logistic regression using the `sim` function from the `arm` R-package[15]. If both songs in a pair have have the same path length, the expected probability of incorrect assignment is 50%. The regression line was thus forced through 50%, although the estimated probability from the data was 47.8%. The three red dots, along with their values, indicate the probability of incorrect assignment for the three stimulus pairs used by Alam et al. The data underlying this figure, consisting of 420 individual cases, were obtained as follows. We used spectograms[3](https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/WBQM4I/Q92O9A) from 31 tutored birds (Alam et al.â€™s Fig. 2c) and generated 20 latent space iterations[4](https://github.com/MartinBulla/rebuttal_alam_2024). Within each iteration, we calculated the shortest path length between syllable clusters. We focused on seven males with five-syllable songs to match the artifical stimuli used by Alam et al. To estimate the true inherent path lengths, we fitted an intercept-only mixed-effects model with bird identity as a random intercept. Using the `coef()` function in R, we extracted an unbiased estimate of the true inherent path length for each male (*what to cite here: https://doi.org/10.2307/2529430, https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jmva.2008.01.004, https://zbmath.org/?format=complete&q=an:0955.62500*).

#' To simulate Alam et al's playback scenario of three stimulus pair contrasting presumably "long path" against "short path" songs, we implemented a leave-one-out resampling apporach. For each iteration, we created a subset of six males by removing one male and repeated the procedure six times, ensuring that each male was removed once. This yielded, for each of the 20 iterations, seven subsets, each with a slightly different set of six males. Within each substet (following Alam et al's Extended Data Fig. 5d), songs were sorted by path length, and three song pairs were created: Pair #1 contrasts the 2nd- and 4th-ranked song, Pair #2 the 1st- and 6th-raanked song, and Pair #3 the 3rd- to 5th-ranked song. This process resulted in 420 comparisons (three pairs per subset across seven subsets and 20 iterations). For each pair, we noted whether a song appearing as "long-path" was actually "short-path" accoring to the pair's true inherent values estimated above, approximating an average over an infinite number of interations. A logistic regression was fitted to estimate how the probability of incorrect "long-path" clasification changes with the path-length difference of a pair from a single iteration.
